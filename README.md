**📊 Amazon EDA Project**

🔍 Project Overview

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Amazon dataset. The goal is to uncover insights, identify patterns, and highlight trends in the data through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration.
The analysis is designed to showcase my data analysis skills, storytelling with data, and ability to derive meaningful business insights.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning & preprocessing
Conduct exploratory data analysis to find patterns and correlations
Visualize insights using clear and interactive plots
Highlight key business insights and recommendations

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Python 🐍
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)
Plotly (interactive visualizations, if used)

📌 Key Insights (Examples)

✅ Distribution of ratings and reviews
✅ Top categories & products contributing to sales
✅ Correlation between product price and rating
✅ Seasonal / trend-based insights (if applicable)

📸 Visualizations

The notebook contains various plots and charts such as:
